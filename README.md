### Boot binaries

This branch contains pre-built boot capsule supervisor binaries for the Travis CI script to use during tests.

The 64-bit RISC-V supervisors are Linux 5.1.16. The 32-bit RISC-V supervisor is Linux 4.19.66. They were built from unchanged source code obtained from the [Linux Kernel Archives](https://kernel.org) using [Buildroot](https://buildroot.org).

See the master branch for instructions on building these binaries, including the Buildroot configuration files.
